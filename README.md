# export-project-html package for Atom

A plugin for the Atom text editor that exports the currently open project to a static website. All code files are exported to html so that when opened in a browser the code is formatted like it would be in Atom, and markdown files are rendered into rich text too.  
This plugin is based on the [export-html package by nubohito](https://atom.io/packages/export-html) (for converting code files to html) and Atom's built-in [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) package for converting markdown files to html, many thanks to the developers of those packages.
